          <span>Dear Madam Ji,</span>
          <br />
          On this Rose Day, every petal holds a piece of my admiration for you. 
          Your presence brightens my world with warmth and happiness. 
          Like a rose in full bloom, your beauty captivates my heart. 
          The red roses speak of the passion and respect I have for you, while the white ones symbolize the purity of our bond. 
          In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom. 
          Thank you for being my constant source of inspiration. 
          Our journey is as sweet and unforgettable as the fragrance of roses. 
          Happy Rose Day, Madam Ji. Here's to many more moments filled with laughter, joy, and respect.
          <br />
