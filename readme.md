## How It Works

1. The **Main Page** (`index.html`) welcomes visitors with a beautifully written Rose Day message, setting a romantic tone, along with a beautifully designed rose graphic to complement the theme.
2. The **Postcard** is designed with hover effects and smooth animations that add a playful and engaging touch to the design.
3. **Hover Interaction**: As the user hovers over the postcard, it gently rotates, providing a dynamic and interactive feel.
4. **Responsive Design**: The layout and content automatically adjust to look great on any device, whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop.
5. **Color and Animation**: The project uses gentle, pleasant colors and smooth animations, making the experience immersive and visually appealing.



## Customizing Your Experience

- **Change the Message**: Head to the `index.html` file and modify the text inside the `<div class="message">` to reflect your own personalized message or the occasion you're celebrating.
- **Adjust Animation Effects**: If you'd like to tweak the hover animations or other transitions, go to the `styles.css` or `postcard.css` files and adjust the keyframes or animation duration.
- **Modify Colors**: You can adjust the color scheme by changing the `background-color`, `color`, and `border` properties in the CSS files. Try out different palettes for a fresh look!

## Expanding the Project

- **Add More Postcards**: If you want to add more interactive postcards, you can duplicate the postcard section in the HTML and adjust its content. You can also create more animations and add new styles to each one.
- **Include Sound Effects**: Add some soft background music or sound effects for interaction. For example, a gentle chime when the user hovers over the postcard or an audio message when the page loads could make it more immersive.
- **Add Social Media Sharing**: Add buttons for sharing the greeting card or postcard on social media platforms. You can use platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram to spread the Rose Day message.
